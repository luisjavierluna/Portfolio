        <p class="lead mb-4">
            My name, as you may have already noticed, is <span> Luis Luna</span> and 
            I am 28. I have a <span> degree in International Trade</span>, as well as 
            almost three years of experience in this area, however, in 2021 thinking 
            about my true interests and future, I decided to make a <span> change in 
            my career</span> and started learning to code in a self-taught way. I 
            decided to focus on learning <span>C#</span> and everything related to its 
            <span>.NET ecosystem</span>, opting to specialize on <span>Backend</span>.
        </p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">
            I always seek to constantly improve and think outside the box to propose <span> new ideas</span>, 
            although I am aware that, to create innovative things, you first have to know what 
            has been done previously. Besides, I am always <span>updating my knowledge and learning 
            new things</span>, as I consider that in the ever-changing technology industry you can be 
            left behind if you get a little distracted.
        </p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">
            I am currently looking <span>for a job opportunity</span> to test my skills and thereby 
            add value to the company that could give me that opportunity. In any situation I will
            continue with this path in programming, as I have found that it is really what I want to do.
